# Timeline and Budget

## 16 Week Project Timeline

We will get together for our Sprint Planning meeting at least once a week throughout the entire project.

## Estimated Total Cost: $6030.00

The numbers I came up with to the estimate this budget are all very rough estimates of the actual cost. Please take this information with a grain of salt.

* This project will last 16 weeks total.
	* The project runs from 08/28/2023 - 12/08/2023
* The approximate time commitment is 3 hours/week per person
	* Our team has four people so there will be about 3 * 4 * 16 = 192 hours of work.
* Wages are roughly estimated as $30.00/hour
	* Wage costs are about 192 * 30 = $5760.00
* Our web hosting through AWS will cost about $5.00/month
	* Over 4 months, it will cost about $20.00
* There may be other misc. operating expenses
	* A rough estimate is $250.00
* So the total project cost is about 5760 + 20 + 250 = $6030.00
