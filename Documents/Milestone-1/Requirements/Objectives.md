# Objectives - BridgeOut

The goal of this project is to develop a web application modeled after the professional social networking site LinkedIn. Our project has a tentative name of BridgeOut. We intend, at minimum, to develop the core functionality of the site. On LinkedIn’s website, they define themselves as such:

> “LinkedIn is the world's largest professional network on the internet. You can use LinkedIn to find the right job or internship, connect and strengthen professional relationships, and learn the skills you need to succeed in your career. You can access LinkedIn from a desktop, LinkedIn mobile app, or mobile web experience.
A complete LinkedIn profile can help you connect with opportunities by showcasing your unique professional story through experience, skills, and education.
You can also use LinkedIn to organize offline events, join groups, write articles, post photos and videos, and more.”
