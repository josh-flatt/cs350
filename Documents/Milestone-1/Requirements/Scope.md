# Scope and Deliverables

We will be focused on developing BridgeOut to include the mobile web portion of LinkedIn’s functionality.
You will be able to create a profile to share your experience, skills, and education with professionals across the web.
You can connect with or follow these professionals to view their posts in a personalized feed on your home page.
You will also be able to post images, videos, and text, as well as create events.
Your posts and events will be viewable to the people you choose to allow to see them,
and they will be likely to show up in the feeds of the people who follow you.
We will deliver a server available on the web that will run all of this functionality.

## Priorities

* **Time** - This project MUST be completed by the end of this class!
* **Money** - The cost of this project is measured in the hours of busy students.
	We will only be able to invest a fixed amount of time while we balance other commitments.
* **Features** - This project is a class project that will not generate income.	
  Due to time/work hour limitations, it will not be as fully featured as the real LinkedIn.
