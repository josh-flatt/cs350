## What I did for Milestone 1

1. Project Charter:
 
	I put together all of the project charter documents which can be found at [BridgeOut - Project Charter](Index.md)

2. General Fixes and Formatting
 
	I fixed and created links in some of the pages such as the instructor page and the readme for milestone 1, as well as fixing some formatting bugs.

2. AI Playbook
 
	I put together my first AI playbook which can be found at [BridgeOut - AI](AI.md)

3. Client Video
 
	I created a video going over the broad idea of the project and the charter. View the video at [BridgeOut - Client Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xXiJfo6HXxfP8IiBjeGvAUJFdBOht4Wr/view?usp=sharing)

## Engineering Investment

I spent about 4 hours on Requirements for Milestone 1.
Our team met for a total of about 2 hours this week.

## What I will do for Milestone 2

For Milestone 2, I will move to the position of designer.

I will make sure that all of our chosen tech stack is up and running and that everything is structured correctly.

I will work with the coder and the rest of the team to get a server stood up (pending further instruction from the professor).

I will gather reference resources for our tech stack and make sure people have access to them.

I will consult with members of my team to learn more about tech I am inexperienced with such as Docker and Django.

I will begin to draft high-level plans on how we can implement the core features of the app.

I will begin data modeling and creating ERDs.

I will begin to make diagrams showcasing the UI of the app.

## Concerns and Challenges

I need to learn more about Docker, Django, and likely AWS technologies. I will require a greater time investment to get up to speed.
