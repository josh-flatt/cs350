## 1. Introduction

This Test Plan outlines the strategy that will be used to verify and ensure that the software product meets its quality objectives and specifications. The plan will cover the approach, resources, test items, features to be tested, features not to be tested, and other particulars of the testing effort.

## 2. Scope

The scope of this Test Plan is limited to:
- Functional Testing
- Performance Testing
- Security Testing
- User Interface Testing

## 3. Objectives

- To ensure comprehensive testing of software components.
- To identify, document, and report defects.
- To ensure alignment with the project scope and requirements.

## 4. Test Strategy

### Initial Testing of Software Components

- **Unit Testing**: Testing of individual modules or components.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing of combined components to evaluate their interactions.
- **System Testing**: Testing the software as a complete system.

### Identify and Report Defects

- Use a bug tracking tool (e.g., JIRA) for defect reporting.
- Severity and Priority should be set for each defect.

## 5. Test Environment

- **Software**: [List all software requirements]
- **Hardware**: [List all hardware requirements]
- **Network**: [Describe network requirements]
  
## 6. Test Cases

Test cases will be documented and maintained in a Test Case Management Tool. Each test case will contain:
- Test Case ID
- Test Scenario
- Test Steps
- Expected Result
- Actual Result

## 7. Defect Reporting

All defects will be reported using a bug tracking tool. The following fields will be populated:
- Issue ID
- Summary
- Description
- Steps to Reproduce
- Severity
- Priority

## 8. Collaboration with Project Manager

- Weekly meetings to update on testing progress and discuss any scope changes.
