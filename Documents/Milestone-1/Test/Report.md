# Engineering Report

## Milestone 1 - Test - Kyle Longaker

Introduction:
During Milestone 1, my team, "Bridge Out," embarked on a series of activities to lay the foundation for our project, which is akin to a LinkedIn-style platform. In this report, I will outline the key actions and decisions made during this phase, as well as our plans for the upcoming Milestone 2.

Accomplishments:

Research and Platform Selection

Conducted comprehensive research to identify suitable hosting options for our project, "Ghost Writer."
After careful consideration, we collectively decided on utilizing Digital Ocean as our hosting platform.
Server Setup

Successfully established a server environment on Digital Ocean, ensuring it meets the requirements for our Ghost Writer project.
Collaborative Deployment

Collaborated closely with the team to facilitate the deployment of our code onto the Digital Ocean server, ensuring a smooth transition.
Upcoming Milestone 2:
For Milestone 2, we have set our sights on the following objectives:

Automatic Deployment

I will work towards implementing an automatic deployment system to streamline our development process.
Team Collaboration

Continued collaboration with my team members to enhance project efficiency and productivity.
Challenges Faced:
One of the challenges encountered during this phase was the uncertainty surrounding database creation. We are actively seeking solutions and expertise in this area to overcome this obstacle.

Engineering Investment:
During Milestone 1, I dedicated approximately 10 hours to these tasks. As our team, "Bridge Out," is currently comprised of just myself, we did not have any formal team meetings.

5-Minute Video Demo:

In summary, Milestone 1 saw the establishment of our team, critical decisions regarding technology stack, successful server setup, and collaborative code deployment. Looking ahead to Milestone 2, we aim to further enhance our project and overcome challenges as we progress toward our goals.
