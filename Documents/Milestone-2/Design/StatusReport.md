## Engineering Investment

I spent about 3 hours on Design for Milestone 2.
Our team met for a total of about 2 hours this week.

## What I will do for Milestone 3

For Milestone 3, I will move to the position of programmer/coder.

* I will begin doing the Incremental Development (Sprints) task.
* I will begin to create some data to build views around and start testing functionality.
* I will help set enviroment variables on the server and get the production application deployed.

## Concerns and Challenges

I have started, but I still need to learn a lot more about Django. I am concerned about how we will display lots of different data in one view to give a dynamic feel to the app. Some animation javascript will likely be wanted or things will seem too static.
