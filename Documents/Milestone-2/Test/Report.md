## Milestone 2 - Test - Josh Flatt

* What did I do?
    * I configured a 0-button deployment pipeline for our project.
        * Configured a deployment script in DigitalOcean to point at GitHub repo.
        * Set up DigitalOcean to redeploy the application whenever code is pushed into the repository.
        * Created a short python script to check for the deployment status of the website.
* What challenges do I have?
    * I was unfortunately not able to figure out how to do automated testing during the code deployment.
    * I also could not figure out how to get DigitalOcean to look into the repository for the app.yaml config within the repo.
* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 4 hours on Test for Milestone 2
    * Our team met for 1-ish hours (In class)
