## What I did for Milestone 3

1. Created Models:
 
	I created first draft, untested versions of all the models outlined in the milestone 2 [software architecture document](../../Milestone-2/Design/Architecture.md).

2. Created Views:
 
	I created basic versions all five of the CRUD views for the AppUser model.

3. Created Tests:

	I created a couple of automated tests for the AppUser Model, and fixed the directory structure so they can be automatically detected.

4. Basic Prototype

	Used the created data + views in deployment and made sure that the live prototype is fully functioning, is styled, and has a sample user loaded in automatically. 

4. AI Playbook:

	I put together my third AI playbook which can be found at [Milestone 3 - AI](AI.md)

5. Status Update Video
    
	I created a summary of the design work completed. View the video at [BridgeOut - Status Update Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rOwcqmRyfr0p_TvpcJcxJFoGJZaPWmCW/view?usp=sharing)

## Engineering Investment

I spent about 6 hours on Code for Milestone 3. It took longer because some learning and some debugging was required.
Our team met for a total of about 2 hours this week.

## What I will do for Milestone 4

For Milestone 4, I will move to the position of tester.

My Responsibilities:
* Setup test framework for automated testing
* Build data tests for CRUD
* Build tests for each view
* Compare lines of test code to lines of product code (should be 50%)

## Concerns and Challenges

I need to work on buiding out more views, and to start thinking about how they will all fit together and be navigated to.
