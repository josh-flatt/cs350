**Views:**

Your application will feature various views for each entity, including list, detail, create, update, and delete functionalities. These views will form the user interface of your LinkedIn-like platform.

**Testing Strategy:**

To ensure the robustness and reliability of your LinkedIn-like website, a comprehensive testing strategy is essential:

1. **CRUD Tests:**
   - Develop automated tests for each CRUD operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for all views specified in your project. This verifies the core functionality of your application.

2. **Utility Function Tests:**
   - Identify and test any additional utility functions, such as search, sort, or filter features, to ensure they work correctly.

3. **Unit Tests:**
   - Write unit tests for individual components, functions, or classes within your codebase. These tests validate the correctness of isolated parts of your application.

4. **Integration Tests:**
   - Perform integration tests to assess how different components of your application work together. Test API endpoints, database interactions, and external service integrations.

5. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
   - Implement E2E tests that simulate user interactions from start to finish, ensuring the entire system functions seamlessly.

6. **Performance Testing:**
   - Conduct load testing, stress testing, and scalability testing to evaluate how your system performs under various conditions and identify performance bottlenecks.

7. **Security Testing:**
   - Test your application for security vulnerabilities, especially when handling sensitive user data. Identify and address potential threats like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

8. **Accessibility Testing:**
   - Ensure your application adheres to web accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG) to provide an inclusive user experience for individuals with disabilities.

9. **Usability Testing:**
   - Gather user feedback through usability testing to assess the overall user experience and identify areas for improvement in terms of user interface and navigation.

10. **Regression Testing:**
    - Continuously run regression tests after each code update to catch any new issues introduced during development.

11. **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD):**
    - Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes, ensuring tests are executed with every code change.

12. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    - Involve actual users or stakeholders in UAT to validate that the application meets their requirements and expectations.

Keep thorough documentation of your testing process, including test cases, results, and any identified issues. This documentation will be instrumental in tracking progress and ensuring the quality and reliability of your LinkedIn-like website as it evolves.
