# Overview of Milestone 3 Testing - Evan Duffield

* What did I do?
    * View testing implemented using test-driven development videos.
    * 20 Unit tests to check database viability, errors.
    * These were implemented in tests.py under the UserTests, DatabaseUnitTests, and UserViewTests.
    * Script written "sourcetest.py" to assure a production environment has at least 50% of the the code from development.
* What will I do?  Design for Milestone 4
    * Create a timeline for the rest of the semester's project.
* What challenges do I have?
    * Trying to create test users while the data models are constantly being updated.
* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 5 hours on Testing for Milestone 3
    * Our team met for 2 hours
* 5-minute Video Demo

# AI Prompts

- Write a python script that compares two python project directories. If the source files are more than 50% identical to eachother, write to console "PASS" alongside the filename and directory.

- Write a python script that checks a locally hosted Django server, and sees if a view properly loads based on if the conditionals of the html template load content.

- Write me a django test class that creates a test user in the database from this model (AppUser).

- Could you expand the original AppUserTestCase class to test creating, getting, deleting, and changing a single user, each in its own method?

- Could you write more 20 variations of the user_data dict so i can use them as test cases?m
