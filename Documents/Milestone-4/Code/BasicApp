Milestone 4 Documentation

Objective: In Milestone 4, the primary focus was on enhancing the user interface and preparing for the testing phase. Key achievements include the creation of a home page and a navigation bar, setting the stage for further development and testing.

Accomplishments:

Home Page Creation:

A home page was successfully designed and implemented for the web application.
The home page serves as the initial landing point for users and provides essential information.
Navigation Bar (Nav Bar) Development:

A navigation bar was created and integrated into the application.
The navigation bar facilitates easy navigation between different sections or views within the application.
Role Transition:

As planned, a shift in responsibilities occurred, with a move to the role of a tester for Milestone 4.
Testing Framework Setup:

Responsibilities as a tester include setting up a test framework for automated testing.
Test Development:

Building data tests for CRUD operations and view-specific tests is underway.
Ensuring comprehensive test coverage is a priority.
Planning for View Expansion:

Recognizing the need to build more views and consider how they fit together and are navigated to.
Challenges and Concerns:

The main challenge ahead is expanding the application's views and ensuring seamless navigation between them.
Maintaining a balance between testing and further feature development is essential.
Next Steps (Milestone 5):

Continue with test development, ensuring robust coverage of CRUD operations and views.
Further expand the application's views, implementing additional functionality as needed.
Address any challenges or concerns that arise during the testing and development process.
Hours Invested (Milestone 4):

Code development: Approximately 6 hours.
Team meetings: Approximately 2 hours.
Conclusion:

Milestone 4 has seen significant progress in the user interface and testing aspects of the project. The home page and navigation bar provide a foundation for user interaction, while the transition to the testing role ensures the application's reliability and quality. Planning for view expansion will be crucial in the next phase of developmen
