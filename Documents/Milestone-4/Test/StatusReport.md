2. Fixed All Failing Tests

	I repaired about 14 failing tests, and added a few new asserts.

3. Measured Code Coverage

	I measured the code coverage of our app.

3. AI Playbook

	I put together my fourth AI playbook which can be found at [Milestone 4 - AI](AI.md)

4. Status Update Video
    
	I created a summary of the work completed. View the video at [BridgeOut - Status Update Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L-kKRw4sst-V44HAFu30mBIvpPyFE_ac/view?usp=sharing)
