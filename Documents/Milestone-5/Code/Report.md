## Milestone 5 - Code - Josh Flatt

* What did I do?
  * I created a list of all remaining features
  * I identified 3-5 iteration steps to implement each feature
  * I created a Test-Driven Development log with feature, iteration, pass/fail, and time.
* What challenges do I have?
  * My major constraint is still time, as I'm currently balancing a full-time courseload, a full-time job, planning a wedding, and moving my fiance from out of state.
* Engineering investment
  * I spent about 4 hours on Code for Milestone 5
  * Our team met for 1-ish hours (In class)
