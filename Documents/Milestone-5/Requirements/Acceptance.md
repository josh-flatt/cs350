# Customer Acceptance Meeting

## BridgeOut Meeting

Professor Seaman seemed fairly happy with the progress of the product but stressed that there is more to be done. He liked how the profiles were shaping up but noted that there was still some core functionality missing
from the application such as the ability to add connections between users, image uploading, and correct page titles. He directed me to use his feedback, as well as the usability study results, and my own audit to bring
all currently present issues standing in the way of the 1.0 release into the product backlog. He said he expected there to be about 30-35 issues in the backlog when this process was finished. The other groups are making
great progress and have implemented some features that are similar to what we're trying to do. It would be of great benefit to examine their repos, and we were encouraged to do so by professor Seaman.
