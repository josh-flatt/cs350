# Usability Test

I sent Joel, the tester assigned to our group, a tasklist and instructions for completing the usability test for out project. The tasklist included the fundamental user actions that we have implemented so far such as creating, editing, and
deleting things such as a account and user profile elements. Joel completed the tasks and sent me a video and his thoughts on things so far. I added all issues he found to the product backlog. Here's what he said: 

## Thoughts on BridgeOut:
* The password requirements were laid out well and I could easily understand what they were.
* I would like to be able to save profile details (First Name, Last Name, etc.) without uploading a profile picture.
* It's unclear what format the dates are supposed to be to be acceptable, I would like either a hint at the expected format or a select date widget.
* I cannot interact with education after adding it, the edit and delete buttons return a 403 forbidden error.
* When deleting a skill it does not show the skill name, so it is unclear what I am deleting.

Outside of those issues, I thought the tasks were easy enough to find where I was supposed to complete them through context clues you had on the web page, and I think you have a solid baseline for the site.
