# Objective: Assess the usability and design of the website, with a focus on the use of red text and its impact on user experience.

## Landing Page:

The initial impression of the landing page is positive, with a good design.
The text explaining what the app does is a bit large, causing users to scroll down to see the login and signup buttons.
Feedback: Consider making the introductory text smaller to improve the user's initial interaction with the site. Red text used here could be misleading, resembling payment-related alerts.
Creating an Account / Logging in:

## Positive Aspects:

Logging in is straightforward and easy to figure out.
Signing up is easy and works properly.
Areas for Improvement:

After signing up, redirecting the user to the home page rather than the login page could enhance the user experience.
Upon logging in, the user is presented with a large page of text with buttons to add projects or go to their profile. Formatting the text slightly smaller would be beneficial.
Adding a "create project" button on the homepage for easier access could improve usability.
Feedback: Consider using red text sparingly, especially for buttons related to critical actions like creating an account or logging in.
Project Management:

## Positive Aspects:

Creating projects is straightforward and intuitive.
Creating task lists is easy for the user.
Projects and task lists are easily editable.
The display of task progress and expected completion dates is helpful.
Areas for Improvement:

It's unclear how to mark an entire project as done, or if it's possible.
The description box for adding tasks seems cramped in its current placement.
Differentiating priorities for tasks could be improved, potentially using different colors for various priorities.
Organizing task lists into completed and incomplete categories may enhance organization.
Adding a deadline feature to projects would be beneficial.
The site crashes if a user tries to add a task without specifying a date.
Feedback: Be cautious with the use of red text in critical areas such as error messages to avoid creating unnecessary confusion.
Calendar:

## Positive Aspects:

The presence of a calendar is a valuable feature.
### Areas for Improvement:

Projects and tasks don't appear on the calendar, limiting its functionality.
Tasks should automatically appear on the calendar on their assigned dates.
Distinguishing project deadlines from tasks on the calendar would be useful.
The ability to add tasks directly from the calendar would enhance usability.
Feedback: Use red text thoughtfully, especially in calendar notifications, to ensure clarity and avoid any misinterpretation.
## Profile:

### Positive Aspects:

User profiles are created upon account creation and autofilled with expected information.
Areas for Improvement:

Autofilling the edit profile form with current information would be a minor improvement.
Exiting the edit profile area without editing anything saves the username and name as an empty string.
Feedback: Review the use of red text, especially in profile-related sections, to maintain a consistent and user-friendly design.
Overall Impressions:

The website is functional and fulfills its intended purpose effectively.
The user can create projects and task lists, mark them as in progress or done, and navigate the site with ease.
The primary issue identified was the entire site crashing when a user tries to add a task without specifying a date.
The main area for improvement is enhancing the calendar's functionality.
Minor adjustments can be made on the project management side, such as distinguishing between low and high priority tasks.
Feedback: Be mindful of the use of red text throughout the site, ensuring it aligns with the intended design and does not confuse users.
Conclusion:

The website demonstrates functionality and an overall good design. However, the use of red text, especially in error messages and critical areas, should be carefully reviewed to ensure it does not give misleading signals or affect the user's experience negatively.
