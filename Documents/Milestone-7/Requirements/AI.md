# AI - ChatGPT Prompts

Below are some of the things I asked Chat GPT in order to take care of my milestone.
Please be advised that I gave my product upgrade document for chat gpt to have for context before using these prompts.

## First Prompt

### Prompt

For the identified defects, explain a suggested fix using AI prompts. Consider the impact of these defects on the overall user experience and prioritize them accordingly.

### Response

Certainly! Let's use AI prompts to generate suggested fixes for the identified defects and evaluate the impact on the overall user experience.

#### Defect 1: Website is not Centered

**AI Prompt:**
"AI, provide a solution to center a website and ensure equal margins on either side of the web page for a better user experience."

**Suggested Fix:**
Consider adjusting the CSS styling for the main container of your web application. You may use the `margin: auto;` property to center the container horizontally. Additionally, ensure that the container has sufficient width to prevent any overflow issues.

#### Defect 2: Displayed time is UTC, not MDT

**AI Prompt:**
"AI, suggest a fix to display date and time in the local timezone (MDT) instead of UTC in a web application."

**Suggested Fix:**
Review the code responsible for displaying date and time. Utilize JavaScript's `toLocaleString` method to convert UTC timestamps to the user's local time. Ensure that the application correctly detects and uses the user's timezone to provide an accurate and user-friendly experience.

#### Defect 3: Navbar is not uniform across site

**AI Prompt:**
"AI, recommend a solution to ensure a consistent appearance of the navbar across different pages of a web application."

**Suggested Fix:**
Evaluate the CSS styling for the navbar and standardize it across all pages. Check for any conditional styling that might be causing variations. Consider creating a separate CSS file for the navbar styles and include it consistently on all pages to ensure a uniform appearance.

#### Impact and Prioritization

1. **Website Centering (Defect 1):**
   - **Impact:** This can significantly affect the aesthetics and initial impression of the website. Users may find it visually unappealing or confusing.
   - **Priority:** High. Addressing this will contribute to a better overall user experience.

2. **Displayed Time (Defect 2):**
   - **Impact:** Users might be confused about the timing of events, especially if the application involves time-sensitive actions.
   - **Priority:** Medium. It's essential for clarity, but may not be as immediately noticeable as the first defect.

3. **Navbar Uniformity (Defect 3):**
   - **Impact:** While not as critical as the others, inconsistent navigation can lead to a disjointed user experience.
   - **Priority:** Medium. This can be addressed to maintain a cohesive design, but it might not be as urgent as the first two defects.

Addressing these issues in the suggested order can contribute to an improved and more user-friendly web application.

## Second Prompt
