## Milestone 7 - Requirements - Josh Flatt

* What did I do?
  * I wrote a Product Upgrade document detailing 3 defects to fix, 3 features to enhance, and 3 capabilities to implement for the 1.1 release.
  * I used Chat GPT to flush out some of my ideas.
* What challenges do I have?
  * The hardest part for me this time around was difficulty understanding what is asked of me.
  As far as I can tell, I accomplished the requirements, but I am uncertain if I stayed within the correct
  scope.
* Engineering investment
  * I spent about 3-ish hours on Requirements for Milestone 7
  * Our team met for 1-ish hours (In class)
